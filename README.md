# Sorting Algorithms Java 🧪🌟

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Repository, where we dive into the world of sorting algorithms using Java! 🚀🎉

## 🚀 Getting Started

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and programming. They are used to organize and manage data,
making it easier to search, analyze, and manipulate. This repository contains the implementation of various sorting
algorithms in Java, along with explanations and examples.

## 🧩 Algorithms

Here's a list of the sorting algorithms you'll find in this repository:

- [X] Bubble Sort
- [X] Selection Sort
- [X] Insertion Sort
- [X] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort
- [ ] Radix Sort
- [X] Shell Sort
- [ ] Tim Sort
- [X] Counting Sort

Each algorithm comes with a dedicated folder containing:

- A Java implementation file 📄
- A clear explanation of the algorithm 📚
- A step-by-step walkthrough with examples 🚶‍♂️🌟
